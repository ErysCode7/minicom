# Next.js Template

This is a Next.js template designed to provide a starting point for building web applications using the Next.js framework. Next.js is a React framework that enables server-side rendering and provides an intuitive development experience.

## Features

Server-side rendering (SSR): Next.js allows you to render React components on the server, providing improved performance and SEO capabilities.

Static site generation (SSG): You can generate static HTML pages for improved performance and easy deployment to content delivery networks (CDNs).

TypeScript support: The template is preconfigured with TypeScript, enabling static type-checking and improved code integrity.

Routing: Next.js provides a powerful routing system that allows you to define dynamic routes and handle navigation between pages easily.

Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS works by scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and any other templates for class names, generating the corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file.

TanStack Query: data-fetching library for web applications, but in more technical terms, it makes fetching, caching, synchronizing and updating server state in your web applications a breeze. One of the best libraries for fetching, caching, synchronizing, and updating asynchronous data in your React app

Hot Module Replacement (HMR): During development, Next.js supports HMR, which allows you to see changes in real-time without refreshing the entire page.

API routes: Next.js allows you to define serverless API endpoints directly within your application, making it easy to create backend functionality.

Code splitting: Next.js automatically splits your code into smaller chunks, improving initial page load times and optimizing resource usage.

## Folder structure

The template follows a typical Next.js project structure:

- `public` - Store static files (images, fonts, etc.) in this directory.
- `src` - Main source code.
- `src/pages` - This folder contains your application's pages. Each file represents a route in your application.
- `src/pages/api` - Define your serverless API routes in this folder.
- `src/modules` - Serves as a home for reusable and modular code components.
- `src/components` - Place reusable React components in this folder.
- `src/styles` - Contains global styles.
- `src/services` - API calls (e.g `products`, `todos`, `etc.`).
- `src/utils` - Helper functions/utilities (e.g. `constants`, `types`).
- `src/hooks` - Custom hooks files (e.g `use-local-storage.tsx`).
- `src/context` - Context.

Feel free to modify the folder structure to fit the needs of your project.
